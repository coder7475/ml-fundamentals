    "# Exploring Clustering Techniques with Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast to _supervised_ machine learning, _unsupervised_ learning is used when there is no \"ground truth\" from which to train and validate label predictions. The most common form of unsupervised learning is _clustering_, which is similar conceptually to _classification_, except that the the training data does not include known values for the class label to be predicted. **Clustering works by separating the training cases based on similarities** that can be determined from their feature values. Think of it this way; **the numeric features of a given entity can be thought of as vector coordinates that define the entity's position in n-dimensional space**. What a clustering model seeks to do is to identify groups, or _clusters_, of entities that are close to one another while being separated from other clusters.\n"
